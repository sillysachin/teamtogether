A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/anon/pen/nKdLp.

 This is a responsive faq, based on a faq I've build for my employer. The CMS didn't provide the opportunity to add features/extensions to it. So I was assigned to build one with jQuery. Here's the result. A FAQ written with jQuery, SASS & a definition list. 

Forked from [John Simanjuntak](http://codepen.io/kenjiroart/)'s Pen [Kenjiro responsive FAQ](http://codepen.io/kenjiroart/pen/dzvpI/).
